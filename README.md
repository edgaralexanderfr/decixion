## ABOUT

Engine for simple text/decision-based games.

## Note for Sun March 29th 2020

We know we're passing through difficult times with COVID-19 pandemic around the world and most people needs to stay at home to prevent the spread of the disease in their countries and communities, that's why I decided to have this initiative so we can have a simple tool that allows us to create quick games that we can share with our beloved ones and spend our time with them.

Not only that, but also to discover our creative side during the isolation and we could also videocall our friends to play multiplayer games and experience unique adventures created by ourselves. Text-based decision games are very easy to make, and we can play them almost everywhere! so why don't give it a try? :)

Stay strong, from the bottom of my heart my best wishes for you and your loved ones!
